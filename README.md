# Project Add 2 Numbers
## Description

In the case where we want to store a large quantity and a very large value, using the string data type in JavaScript would be more optimal than the number data type.

The number data type in JavaScript has limitations on the value range. Although JavaScript supports the number data type to represent large integers, the precision of large integers is limited by the floating-point representation system known as "Double-precision floating-point format". This means that large integers will not be accurately represented to the last digit.

On the other hand, using the string data type to store large numbers allows us to maintain the full precision of the number string without losing any trailing digits. By manipulating the string of numbers, we can perform operations and handle the data as needed.

Based on the above reasons, I am undertaking this project to efficiently perform addition operations on large numbers.

This project demonstrates a web application that performs addition of large numbers using JavaScript. It provides a user interface where two numbers can be entered, and upon clicking a button, the sum of the numbers is calculated and displayed. The application also keeps a history of the addition operations and allows downloading the logging file.

## Installation
No installation is required for this project. Simply open the index.html file in a web browser to run the application.

## Usage
1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2. Enter two numbers in the provided input fields.
3. Click the "Sum" button to perform the addition.
4. The result will be displayed in the output field.
5. The operation history will be logged on the console.
6. To download the logging file, click the "Download logging file" link.

## Code Structure

1. The HTML file (index.html) contains the structure and user interface of the web application.
2. The CSS file (styles.css) provides styling for the HTML elements.
3. The JavaScript file (script.js) implements the addition logic, logging functionality, and event handling.
